A Python-based face recognition attendance system that captures real-time webcam footage, recognizes faces, and logs attendance in a CSV file. The project leverages OpenCV for video capture and image processing, and the `face_recognition` library for facial recognition.

## Features

- **Real-Time Face Recognition:** Detects faces from webcam footage and matches them against a pre-defined set of known faces.
- **Attendance Logging:** Automatically logs attendance with a timestamp whenever a recognized face is detected.
- **CSV Output:** Attendance records are saved in a CSV file, making it easy to track and analyze attendance data.
