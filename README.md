# Face-Recognition-Attendance-System

This project is a Python-based Face Recognition Attendance System. It uses the OpenCV and face_recognition libraries to detect and recognize faces in real-time through a webcam. The system then marks attendance by logging the recognized faces into a CSV file.

## Features

- **Face Recognition:** Identifies individuals using pre-stored training images.
- **Real-Time Attendance:** Captures and logs attendance based on face recognition.
- **Easy Setup:** Simple setup with a virtual environment and installation via `requirements.txt`.
